## About

We're right in the progress of migrating to github.

PyCS is a software toolbox to estimate time delays between COSMOGRAIL light curves, developed at EPFL’s LASTRO.
Please see the documentation available at http://www.cosmograil.org for installation instructions and further info.

Quick :
python setup.py install

However, read the section about installation on the website. You might prefer to simply add the PyCS directory to your python path.

To create a source distribution :
python setup.py sdist
