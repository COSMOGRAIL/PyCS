About this documentation
========================

The documentation is build using Sphinx : `<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.

Some of it (e.g., the tutorial) is written in form of plain .rst files, and other parts are created from the docstrings of the python code, by ``sphinx-apidoc``.

So we should try to stick to the sphinx recommendations about docstrings, and make use of the described way to add crosslinks to the documentation etc.


To build the documentation locally :

::

	cd sphinx
	(make clean)
	(make apidoc)
	make html 


The ``make clean`` removes anything that gets built (no need to do this each time), and ``make apidoc`` generates the structure of the API documentation (idem, no need to call this if no change to the subpackage structure was made). See the Makefile for details.

You can then open ``index.html`` that you will find in ``sphinx/build/html/`` with your browser...


readthedocs.org
---------------

The documentation gets autogenerated on readthedocs.org, directly by cloning the sources on GitHub, whenever something is pushed.

To make this simple, the structure written by ``make apidoc`` is actually in the git repo. Note that readthedocs.org needs the ``setup.py`` installation to work.
