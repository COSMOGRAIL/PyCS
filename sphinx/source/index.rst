============================

About
-----

PyCS is a software toolbox to estimate time delays between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars, from resolved light curves such as obtained by the `COSMOGRAIL <http://www.cosmograil.org/>`_ monitoring program. It comes in the form of a python package, and heavily depends on ``numpy``, ``scipy``, and ``matplotlib`` for its core functionality. The `repository is on GitHub <https://github.com/COSMOGRAIL/PyCS>`_.

To measure time delays with ``pycs``, you'll typically write a script calling some high-level functions provided by the package. PyCS allows you to compare different point estimators (including your own), without much code integration.

If you have already read our :doc:`papers<citing>`, you might want to proceed with :doc:`installation`, or the :doc:`tutorial/tutorial`. To get a quick first impression of how PyCS looks in practice, install PyCS and then go directly to the :doc:`tutorial/demo1`. These show you how to **reproduce** the figures from the method paper.

.. warning:: Please read this :doc:`important warning about using PyCS<warning>`.
