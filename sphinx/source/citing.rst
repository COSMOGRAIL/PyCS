Citing PyCS in a publication
============================

To cite PyCS, we suggest both of the following papers:

* Tewes et al. 2013

  - `COSMOGRAIL XI: Techniques for time delay measurement in presence of microlensing, A&A 553 A120 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201220123>`_.
  - This paper describes the curve-shifting algorithms of PyCS. 

* Bonvin et al. 2016

  - `COSMOGRAIL XV: Assessing the achievability and precision of time-delay measurements, A&A 585 A88 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526704>`_.
  - This paper demonstrates the performance of PyCS on synthetic data from the first Time Delay Challenge.
